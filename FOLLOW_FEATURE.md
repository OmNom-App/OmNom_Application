# Follow Feature Implementation

## Overview
The follow feature allows users to follow other users and see who they're following on their own profile.

## Components Added

### 1. FollowButton Component (`src/components/FollowButton.tsx`)
- Displays a follow/unfollow button on other users' profiles
- Automatically checks if the current user is following the target user
- Handles follow/unfollow operations with loading states
- Only shows when viewing other users' profiles (not your own)

### 2. FollowedUsers Component (`src/components/FollowedUsers.tsx`)
- Displays a list of users that the current user is following
- Shows on the user's own profile only
- Includes links to each followed user's profile
- Shows empty state with call-to-action when not following anyone

## Database Schema
The follow functionality uses the existing `follows` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE follows (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  follower_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  following_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(follower_id, following_id),
  CHECK (follower_id != following_id)
);
```

## Features Implemented

### Profile Page Updates
1. **Follow Button**: Added to profile header when viewing other users
2. **Follower/Following Counts**: Shows follower and following counts in profile stats
3. **Following Section**: Added to own profile showing list of followed users

### User Experience
- **Real-time Updates**: Follow button state updates immediately after clicking
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during follow/unfollow operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for network issues
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop

### Security
- **RLS Policies**: Database has proper Row Level Security policies
- **User Validation**: Users can only follow/unfollow through proper authentication
- **Self-follow Prevention**: Database constraint prevents users from following themselves

## Usage

### For Users
1. **Following Someone**: Visit any user's profile and click the "Follow" button
2. **Unfollowing**: Click the "Unfollow" button on a profile you're already following
3. **Viewing Followed Users**: On your own profile, see the "Following" section with all users you follow

### For Developers
```typescript
// Using the FollowButton component
<FollowButton targetUserId="user-id-here" />

// Using the FollowedUsers component (only for own profile)
<FollowedUsers userId={currentUserId} />
```

## Database Operations
- **Check Follow Status**: Query follows table for existing relationship
- **Follow User**: Insert new record into follows table
- **Unfollow User**: Delete record from follows table
- **Get Followed Users**: Join follows and profiles tables

## Future Enhancements
- Followers list (users who follow you)
- Follow suggestions
- Follow notifications
- Feed of followed users' recipes
