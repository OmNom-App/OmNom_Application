## üöÄ Production Deployment Checklist

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Set up production Supabase project
- [ ] Configure environment variables:
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`

### Build & Deploy
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to create production build
- [ ] Deploy to production server/CDN
- [ ] Configure HTTPS
- [ ] Set up proper domain and DNS

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Set up error monitoring (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Configure application logging
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Monitor for security incidents

### Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
2. **CORS Configuration**: Ensure proper CORS settings for production domains
3. **SSL/TLS**: Use HTTPS only in production
4. **Security Headers**: Consider additional headers like HSTS
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
6. **Backup Strategy**: Implement database backup strategy
7. **Monitoring**: Set up security monitoring and alerting

### Supabase Production Checklist
- [ ] Enable Row Level Security on all tables
- [ ] Configure proper storage bucket policies
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configure proper authentication settings
- [ ] Review and test RLS policies
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging

## üîç Security Testing

Before going live, consider:
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

## üìù Notes

- All console logs have been removed for production
- Error messages are generic to prevent information disclosure
- Security headers are configured for maximum protection
- Authentication flow is secure with proper session management
- Database access is properly restricted with RLS policies
